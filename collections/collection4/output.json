When molecules collide, the kinetic energy of the molecules can be used to stretch, bend, and ultimately break bonds, leading to chemical reactions.

However, if the molecules are moving fast enough with a proper collision orientation, such that the kinetic energy upon collision is greater than the minimum energy barrier, then a reaction occurs.

If the substrate could go with a couple of different reaction pathways, then the reaction conditions, including the basicity/nucleophilicity of the reagent, temperature, solvent etc., play the important role to determine which pathway is the major one. Our discussions therefore will start from the different type for substrates, then explore the condition effects on that substrate.",
